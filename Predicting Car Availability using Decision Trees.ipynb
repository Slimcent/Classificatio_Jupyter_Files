    "\n",
    ".Different to other complex learning algorithms, the results of decision trees can be interpreted. It's fair to say that decision trees are not blackbox type models.\n",

    ".Trees can handle imbalanced datasets. You will only have to adjust the weights of the classes.\n",

    "A well-known downside of decision trees is that they tend to overfit the data easily(pretty much assumed they will always overfit at first). One way to overcome overfitting is to reduce the maximum depth of the decision tree (refered to as max_depthhyperparameter) in decision trees."
