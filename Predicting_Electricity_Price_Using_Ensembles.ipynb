    "How it Works: Multiple copies of the same algorithm are trained on different subsets of the training data (created by bootstrapping, which involves sampling with replacement). The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from all models, typically by averaging for regression tasks and majority voting for classification tasks.\n",

    "Boosting\n",
    "How it Works: Models are trained sequentially, where each new model focuses on the errors made by the previous models. The predictions from all models are combined, often with weights assigned to each model based on its performance.\n",

    "Stacking (Stacked Generalization)\n",
    "How it Works: Multiple models (base learners) are trained on the same dataset. A meta-model (or second-level model) is then trained on the outputs of the base models to make the final prediction. This meta-model learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models.\n",
    "Example: You might use logistic regression as a meta-model to combine the outputs of several different base classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voting\n",
    "How it Works: Multiple models (typically of different types) are trained, and their predictions are combined through a voting scheme. For classification tasks, it could be majority voting or weighted voting, and for regression, it could be averaging.\n",
    "Example: A simple voting classifier that uses the majority vote of decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors."

      "**Electricity** is a widely used dataset described by M. Harries and analyzed by J. Gama (see papers below). This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations.\n",

      "The dataset (originally named ELEC2) contains 45,312 instances dated from 7 May 1996 to 5 December 1998. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of 30 minutes, i.e. there are 48 instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has 5 fields, the day of week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price (UP or DOWN) in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last 24 hours (and removes the impact of longer term price trends). \n",
